    "We start using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to read the content of the CSV files and use it. Let us have a look at the first 10 rows of each file, to check which contents are provided by the *ratings.csv* and the *movies.csv* files. To do so, we use the *read_csv* method which returns a pandas [Dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) object containing the information read from the csv file. Such object provides several methods to manipulate the data in it, and we will use the [head](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.head.html) method, which returns the first *n* rows of the dataframe. We use also the [display](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.display.html#IPython.display.display) method, that allows to print information nicely in a jupyter notebook."

    "Let us have a look at the number of ratings we have for each movie. First, we select the columns *user* and *item*. Then, we can use the [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) method to group the columns given a specific column value. The method returns a [Groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/groupby.html) object, which provides methods to aggregate the values of each group. We aggregate by *item*, to count the number of users that rated each item. To compute this, we use the [count](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.count.html) method which returns a Dataframe object, in which we will have a row for each movie, and the number of users who rated each movie in the *user* column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we visualize the distribution of the number of evaluations for each movie using the [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library. We use the [displot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html#seaborn.displot) method, specifying `x='user'`."

    "Note that here, we have on the horizontal axe the number of users that evaluated a movie, and on the vertical axe the number of movies having the corresponding number of evaluations. We migh want to visuaize instead on the horizontal axe the movies, and on the vertical axe the number of users who evaluated it. There are different ways to do it, we will just sort the previous Dataframe by *user* (i.e. the number of user evaluations for the corresponding movie) in a descending order, using the [sort_values](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html) method of the Dataframe object, and then reset the index two times, in order to have a progressive id for the movies (the [reset_index](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.reset_index.html) function will create a nerw index assigning a progressive identifier to each row in the Dataframe). The, we just plot the line having *index* on the horizontal axe and *user* on the vertical axe. "

    "#### 2. Non personalized recommendations: ordering by average rating\n",
    "\n",
    "A first idea to provide recommendations for our users can be to use the ratings provided and determine the highest rated movies. To do so, we first need to compute the average rating for each movie, and then determine the top rated. Let's use again the functions provided by the Dataframe object. We can use the [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) again. To compute the average ratings, we use the [mean](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.mean.html) method which returns a Dataframe object, in which we will have a row for each movie, and the average rating will be in the *rating* column. Finally, we use the [sort_values](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html) method to sort the movies by rating, and we print the first 10 movies."

We use the TF-IDF model, hance we will use the [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) class, which allows us to easily compute TF-IDF vectors for our movies. We need to instantiate the a *TfidfVectorizer* object, and then we need to use the [fit_transform](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.fit_transform) method. The method fits (trains) the features model, and then transform our data, returning the TF-IDF matrix representation.

Of course, we could use a different approach, treating the problem as a classification problem. In that case, we would need to transform our ratings to obtain labels. We will see that later today.
